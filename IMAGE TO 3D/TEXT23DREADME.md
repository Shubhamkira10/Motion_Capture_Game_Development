# Greedy3D

## Overview
**Greedy3D** is a Jupyter Notebook that explores a 3D implementation of a greedy algorithm. It demonstrates how greedy strategies can be applied to solve optimization problems in a three-dimensional space.

## Features
- Implements a **greedy algorithm** in 3D.
- Utilizes **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- Generates **3D visualizations** using Matplotlib.
- Provides a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and implementation.

## Installation
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook





## Usage
Open the notebook with Jupyter:
jupyter notebook Greedy3D.ipynb
